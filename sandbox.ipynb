       "In this paper, we examine the literature dealing with the \"adverse effect\" of information-overload, i.e., information fatigue syndrome. The authors focus on three main areas: technology as an aid to overcome information overload; increased informationliteracy; and increasing information literacy. In particular, they discuss information overloads in business enterprises where people are constantly being bombarded by a large number of unstructured, unsolicited, or incomplete information. This information overload problem is particularly prevalent in the age of information technology. Various studies have examined the effects of information overload on individuals' ability to effectively deal with complex information. According to one study, communication overload occurs when too many messages compete for our time but do not provide sufficient information to adequately process them. Other studies suggest that it can be avoided if managers learn to use concepts rather than relying on details and data. An intelligent agent such as an information specialist may reduce information load because there is more information available at a faster rate, thereby improving efficiency"

    "text = '''The problem of information overload is widely recognised today. Living in an “information society”, we are bombarded with information whether or not we actively seek it. We are all affected by the increasing number of sources from which information emanates. Who does not receive unwanted information through the letter box almost daily? Growing numbers of television channels provide more viewing choice and result in burgeoning programme guides to be ploughed through in the often elusive search for an interesting programme to watch amongst the escalating dross churned out. Newspapers, radio and television often disseminate the same news items with such an intensity of coverage that one can soon develop a perception of information overload but here one can choose to ignore that information. In the workplace, however, information is seen as the key to success for organisations and many people have to deal with an overwhelming amount of information from many sources as part of their job. People cannot afford to ignore information in the workplace. “Professional and personal survival in modern society clearly depends on our ability to take on board vast amounts of new information. Yet that information is growing at an exponential rate” (Lewis, 1996).\n",
    "\n",
    "“The technological developments of the last 50 years have made more information more available to more people than at any other time in human history” (Feather, 1998). While there are obvious benefits from easier access to information, research has found that information overload can lead to stress, loss of job satisfaction and physical ill health (Lewis, 1996).\n",
    "\n",
    "The machines we have invented to produce, manipulate and disseminate information generate information much faster than we can process it. It is apparent that an abundance of information, instead of better enabling a person to do their job, threatens to engulf and diminish his or her control over the situation. It is now widely recognised that stress can be experienced from a feeling of lack of control. We can unwittingly allow information technology to become the driver instead of harnessing it as tool to enhance rather than diminish our lives. The problem of information overload is obviously not going to recede and solutions need to be found to enable people to reduce the amount of information overload they experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper reviews the literature on the subject of information overload, with particular reference to business organisations, in order to provide an overview of the growth of the problem and the current situation. References to the problem of information overload are scattered throughout the literature and this review is, therefore, necessarily selective while aiming to present a balanced overview highlighting significant points garnered from extensive reading of the literature. Various solutions that have been put forward in the literature are briefly described and suggestions for further research are made.\"'''\n",
